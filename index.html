    </header>

    <main>
      <p>
        As we begin our work in seeking the Lord for nominees for elected
        leadership, we would like to ask you for your help. For a brief
        description of the elected positions to help you see the leadership
        roles for which we are providing nominees, click
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghyB7XPrXqgcy4eZjtcUpTQcJxosPJU0/view" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are filling leadership positions as elders (overseeing the purpose
        and people of the church), governing board members (overseeing the
        budget and policies), and deacons (serving the needs of people in
        concrete ways). We are seeking spiritually discerning leaders who can
        lead and navigate the cultural complexities of our diverse congregation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who have you noticed within our membership who are faithfully serving
        well? Members who are walking with Jesus in a way that reflects his
        character as they serve him at work, at home, or within the body of
        Christ. They could be the person who helps with the cleanup, or leaders
        of groups, or gifted teachers. Maybe they have a compassionate heart, a
        discerning spirit, or are servant leaders who you look up to for
        spiritual guidance; or is there someone you know who is good with
        numbers like an accountant who you respect as spiritually mature?
      </p>

      <p>
        Though there are many leaders at Wellspring using their gifts to serve
        God and others well, the elected positions, required by our bylaws, must
        be members. But donâ€™t worry about whether the person you refer is a
        member or not. We will figure that out and use the members in the
        initial stage of vetting process.
      </p>

      <p>
        All we ask is that you fill out this simple form telling us who, and why
        you think they could be considered for one of these leadership
        positions. If you feel more comfortable talking to a person, the
        Nominating Committee is listed below. Or you can reach a Nominating
        Committee member by contacting us at
        <a href="mailto:nomcom@wellspringalliance.net">nomcom@wellspringalliance.net</a>.

        Thank you,<br>
